[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-java-masterminds): This was the final project that I did in AP Java, I worked on this in a group of 4 people. It is a pretty basic java version of tic tac toe using the Swing GUI widget tool kit, but it does include a bot so you can play it by yourself. This project sums up most of my java knowledge that I learned in AP Java. Since this I have learned some more Java, primarily in Android Studio.
